# Knowledge Nexus - Obsidian PKM System

A comprehensive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system built in Obsidian, combining PARA and Zettelkasten methodologies for effective learning, project tracking, and knowledge development.

## üìå Introduction

This Obsidian vault serves as an integrated system for **personal knowledge management**, **project tracking**, and **continuous learning**. Built upon a hybrid framework that merges action-oriented organization with idea-centric knowledge development, it provides a comprehensive environment for capturing, processing, and retrieving information.

The vault was originally based on a structured PKM template, extensively customized to enhance:
- **Knowledge synthesis** through interconnected notes and structured hierarchies
- **Project management** with status tracking and priority assignment
- **Information retrieval** via powerful searching and dynamic dashboards
- **Temporal organization** through daily, weekly, and monthly reflection cycles

Key benefits of this setup include:
- **Modularity**: Each component serves a specific purpose while remaining connected to the whole
- **Scalability**: The structure grows organically with your knowledge and projects
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different types of content and knowledge domains
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined capture and retrieval processes reduce friction

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

The vault is organized into five core components, each serving distinct but interconnected purposes:

| Folder     | Purpose                                                                         |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HUB`      | Central navigation and dashboards for accessing all vault components            |
| `PARA`     | Action-oriented content organized by projects, areas, resources, and archives   |
| `ZETA`     | Idea-centric content using Zettelkasten methodology for knowledge development   |

   - Define scope, objectives, and deadlines
   - Set priority level and initial status

2. **Project Execution**
   - Update status as project progresses (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed)
   - Link relevant resources and reference materials
   - Track tasks and deadlines via Homepage dashboard

3. **Project Completion**
   - Change status to "Completed"
   - Review project outcomes
